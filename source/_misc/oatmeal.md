title: Some nice things to have on oatmeal
---

My friends often ask me: “Alan”—they ask—“my morning bowl of oatmeal
is so boring! What can I do to add some pizzazz?”

<aside>

<small>(This is not true. No one has ever asked me this.)</small>

</aside>

Fortunately, I have spend a good deal of time thinking upon the subject
of oatmeal and experimenting with different toppings. Here are a few I
have found success with:

* Peanut butter and honey
* Tahini and honey
* Olive oil, parmesan, freshly ground black pepper
* Toasted pumpkin seeds, pomegranate seeds, feta cheese
* Roasted brussels sprouts, a poached egg, sea salt, freshly ground
  black pepper
* Pickled red onions, mashed avocado, goat cheese, a pinch of cayenne

Let me know if you find any other combinations of toppings you feel
should be more widely known, and I will add it to this list!
