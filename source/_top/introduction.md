## About me

## About this website

<b>Why is it called “three dots”?</b> Because three dots is the visual form of the ellipsis (‘…’), and
I am an elliptical man.

<b>Why have a website? Why write a blog?</b> I don't know. I like having
my own corner of the internet where I can experiment with prose and
fiddle with stylesheets. If
only I could bring my guests some sparkling water!

I post new content <em>highly</em> irregularly.
Blog posts are dated by when I <em>originally</em> composed
their content. This date may be months or years earlier than
when the post appears here; I often post backdated items that
I had written down somewhere else much earlier.

I am <s>constantly</s> intermittently adding, editing, removing stuff,
adding stuff back again, and tweaking the design of the site, so
check back again soon!

I hope your find this website an amusing stop on your
internet travels.

Yours,<br>
Alan
