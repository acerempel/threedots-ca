<!-- FOLD -->

I am so interested in this. I really find it bonkers that most of the
width of our streets is allotted for the zooming of large motorized
vehicles, so that no one on foot can safely traverse it, except to cross
from one side to the other as directed by lighted symbols.

Although the word <i>street</i> is often now synonymous with
<i>road</i>, i.e. a travelling-way for vehicles, it obviously has not
always been, since streets have existed for far longer than automobiles
have. Streets used to be the province of people walking about, kids
playing, streetcars trundling along, cyclists, horses, etc.: it turns
out that all these did not cede the majority of the street to the
automobile lightly.
