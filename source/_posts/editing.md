I have a great love of *editing*. Semicolon—<br>or m-dash? Too many syllables? Too languid?<br>too clipped? One sentence twisting, another<br>straight-ahead. Warp; point; zig; zag. I once<br>dropped my house-keys such that they fell<br>between the boards of the front porch:<br> I rescued them
with a bent coat-hanger.
