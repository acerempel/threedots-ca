I like books in which the sentences are beautiful and I have no idea
what is going on.<!-- FOLD --> Or, I have some idea of the direction of the action,
but the plot is somewhat abstract, and is largely eclipsed—so are the
characters—by the energy between the words. Even time and place are
fluidly conceived and rendered impressionistically; what is concrete,
what persists, is not place or action or character but desire, fear,
love, and even, at times, contentment.

Such a book is <cite>This Is How You Lose The Time War</cite>. Check out
this sentence:

> In downthread server farms couched in remnant icebergs’ hearts, she
> circles back upon her trail, glimpses the shadow, fires her fléchette
> pistol through rackspace gaps, birthing blue sparks.
