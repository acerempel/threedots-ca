description: In which I have danced
---

Whatever is nec­es­sary
that such dance par­ties as that of last night
should hap­pen again—that’s what mat­ters to me.<!-- FOLD --> That
everybody should be able to dance with their
friends in a safe and com­fort­able space and know this and dance freely
and en­joy it and have lots of fun, know­ing that they are among
friends—that is what is most worth­while to me.
