I am Alan; this is my website.
Currently it consists of my <a href="/#blog"><b>blog</b></a>, which I update according as I
have spare time and whim, as well as some <a href="/#miscellaneous"><b>miscellaneous lists</b></a>. There is also
a page with a little more <a href="/introduction"><b>about</b></a> this website and me.
Feel free to browse.
