title: All the words I have ever looked up in the dictionary on my phone

  - Why do it this way? My phone has no standalone
    dictionary app, I don't want to get such an app (because choosing which
    app is too much trouble), and I don't want to use a
    search engine (because then I have to decide which one of the results I want to click
    on—moreover, not all online dictionaries are reputable).

If I want to look up a word in the dictionary or thesaurus on my phone,
I (rather than Googling it or something) write it down in my ‘Notes’ app, press my finger on it, and tap “Look
Up”.{% note 1 %} 
Some of them I looked up because I did not know them at all, some of them because I was curious
about their etymology, and of some I wanted the definition of in order to
investigate a linguistic dispute amongst my gathered friends.
Here are the contents of that note, in chronological order of when I looked them up:
