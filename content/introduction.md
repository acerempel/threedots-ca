<h2 class="semibold fs-5-4 mt-3-4 mb-1-2">About me</h2>

I am a student at the [University of King's College][UKC]—hopefully
graduating soonish, but we'll see. (I've been saying that for a while
now.) I enjoy dabbling in programming, mostly in [Haskell][].
Outside of this website, I can be found on [Instagram][]
and [Subreply][].

<b>Why “three dots”?</b> Because three dots is the visual form of the ellipsis (‘…’), and
I am an elliptical man.

<h2 class="semibold fs-5-4 mt-3-4 mb-1-2">About this website</h2>

I post new content highly irregularly.
Blog posts are dated by when I <em>originally</em> composed
their content. This date may be months or years earlier than
when the post appears here—I often post backdated items that
I had written as a note to myself much earlier.

On the technical side, the website consists of statically generated
HTML (and some CSS, written by hand with the assistance of Sass), hosted
with GitHub Pages. The HTML is generated with
[Eleventy](https://eleventy.dev).

I am <s>constantly</s> intermittently adding, editing, removing stuff,
adding stuff back again, and tweaking the design of the site, so
check back again soon!

I hope your find this website an amusing stop on your
internet travels.

Yours,<br>
Alan
