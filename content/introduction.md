<h2>About me</h2>

Good evening! I am Alan. I am a student at the [University of King's College][UKC];
I drink a lot of tea. Those are pretty much the only two facts
about me that have remained true over the past seven years.

<b>Where else on the internet can you find me?</b> On [Instagram][];
other places too; I am pretty searchable. I also have an additional blog, which is secret.

<h2>About this website</h2>

<b>Why is it called “three dots”?</b> Because three dots is the visual form of the ellipsis (‘…’), and
I am an elliptical man.

<b>Why have a website? Why write a blog?</b> I don't know. I like having
my own corner of the internet where I can experiment with prose and
fiddle with stylesheets. Some people are good at making their bedrooms
or living rooms into nice spaces that bring them comfort, look lovely, display things they value, and tell visitors something
about themselves. I'm not so good at that in real life, but my website is the fruit of my hope to create
something analogous for myself on the internet. If
only I could actually bring my guests some sparkling water!

I post new content <em>highly</em> irregularly.
Blog posts are dated by when I <em>originally</em> composed
their content. This date may be months or years earlier than
when the post appears here; I often post backdated items that
I had written down somewhere else much earlier.

On the technical side, the website consists of statically generated
<abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> (and some handwritten CSS), hosted
with GitHub Pages. The HTML is generated with
[Eleventy](https://eleventy.dev).

I am <s>constantly</s> intermittently adding, editing, removing stuff,
adding stuff back again, and tweaking the design of the site, so
check back again soon!

I hope your find this website an amusing stop on your
internet travels.

Yours,<br>
Alan
