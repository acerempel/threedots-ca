<p>As I was walking down Duncan street last Sunday evening, I
came across a tree that that had a face—eyes, a nose and a
mouth affixed to its bark.<!-- FOLD --> I paused to admire it and take a
picture—but at this point I was accosted by a couple of
children who were hanging out in the yard of the house to my
left. Fortunately, being accosted by children happens to
number among my favourite hobbies. So we struck up a
conversation. They asked me how old I was.—Twenty, I
replied; they asked, as though it followed
naturally,—Are you married?—No, I said.—Why not? they
said. You’re twenty years old, you’re tall, you have long
and luscious hair (perhaps they said ‘flowing’ instead of
‘luscious’, I don’t remember): what are you waiting for?—I
told them that I felt I was in no particular hurry, that I
have so many other things in my life occupying my attention,
and that——Nonsense, they said. Here’s what you should
do. The next girl you see, you go up to her and say, “Hello!
My name is”–what’s your name, again?—Alan.—“Hello! My
name is Alan! Do you want to get married?”—Wouldn’t that
seem a bit abrupt? I said.—I guess so, said the
one.—Hey! said the other, no, do this: The next girl you
see, give her some flowers, and then she’ll like you and ask
<em>you</em> to marry <em>her</em>!—I told them I liked this plan better.</p>
