  I muse upon the excellences of paper notebooks, as opposed
  to electronic programs designed for comparable purposes.

I have started using a paper notebook for an agenda/planner/to-do-list
thing. It's been an interesting experiment. <!-- FOLD --> I notice that I tend to waste all kinds of time
*configuring* whatever computer program I use, but there is no such thing as that
with the paper notebook, because “configuring” it and using it
are one: both of these consist in writing lines, symbols, and characters with the pen on the page.
You create the scaffolding the same way you create the content. This is
not so with computer-based tools because, while writing prose on a computer is very easy –
a computer even has special hardware designed for it –
organizing that prose *visually* – as one wants to do when one
is making an agenda (a section of the page for each day of the week, for example) – is vastly more cumbersome.
Some computer-based task-management or calendar-management tools are actually very good – but
they cost at least as much as my notebook did, and I have more confidence that my notebook
will be useful to me, for a long time and in a variety of contexts, than any piece of software.
