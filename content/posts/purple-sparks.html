<p>I used to be able to make purple sparks shoot from my
fingertips. I just had to snap my fingers at just the right
angle, with just the right force, when the humidity was just
right, when my hair was tied up in a bun in just the right
way …

<!-- FOLD -->

<p>I haven’t done that since about a year and a half ago now.
Am I still capable of it? I don’t know how to tell—short
of doing it again, of course. I haven’t even tried—why
not? I think I’m afraid of finding out for certain that I’ve
lost it. If I don’t even attempt it, then I can still
imagine that I have the power to do it. Then again, though,
even if I try it—having found the exact circumstances
under which I’ve always observed succeed—and fail, that
need not mean I’ve lost my purple sparks permanently.
Perhaps there is some other condition that needed to obtain
which I wasn’t aware of. Or perhaps the sparks will come
back in their own time.
