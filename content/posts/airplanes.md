<meta content="A blog post in which I argue that airplanes are placeless, or alienate us from place.---Not that anyone was arguing otherwise. Really, why would anyone in the industrialized world think of any kind of vehicle as informed by place? Isn&#39;t the purpose of modern motorized vehicles to remove us from place? And will not self-driving cars accomplish this yet more effectively?

about airplanes. Travelling
by airplane is essentially a form of teleportation, in that
it involves travelling from a starting point to a
destination without traversing any of the intervening
places. One does traverse some kind of intervening <em>space</em>
(namely, some part of the atmosphere), but this is not humanly
habitable space – not space that has the <em>capacity</em> to
contain places.—What then of mid-journey airport layovers? Well,
airports tend to be placeless, or un-placed, or deprived of
place-context, or only-quasi-places, in a different sense:
they are typically very poorly connected to the urban fabric
of the city which they serve.</p>
<p>In this way airplanes stand in contrast from bicycles, feet, horses, and most other
land-based modes of transport (even automobiles, to a
degree, although less so if the journey mostly involves
controlled-access highways), as well as non-motorized boats. They may also be contrasted – interestingly – with
hot-air balloons, which are vulnerable to the whims of the
wind, like sailboats – and thus susceptible to a part of
the particular character of the <em>place</em> they are in.
Motorboats, then, distance themselves somewhat from place,
because they have a degree of indifference to the wind
and other environmental conditions. (Cruise ships are very
obviously – and <em>very</em> deliberately – removed from place.)</p>
<p>(I was in a class this summer on the History
of the Marine Sciences, and in one lecture the professor
told us about a theory of the modern scientific laboratory
as a ‘placeless place’. I suppose this could be elaborated
as: a laboratory <em>is</em> a place, but it is not <em>in</em> a place.
Maybe. In any case, presumably whoever came up with that formulation
thought it through; whether, then, airplanes are
non-places or whether they are placeless places is, strictly
speaking, undetermined.)</p>
