I am very fond of public transit. I think about it a lot. I think it's
really important; I want it to become better, and I often contemplate
ways of improving it in whatever city I am living in. Why is that?<!-- FOLD -->

It's not because I love riding transit. I enjoy riding a bus or train
most when I take it infrequently and for longer distances than I
regularly travel. For getting around the
city every day – to work, to school, to my friends' house – I would much rather either walk or
ride a bicycle, depending on the distance. I do not find even the most
comfortable kinds of public transit – such as streetcars and subways –
to be intrinsically enjoyable when I am on a routine journey and am
constrained for time. Occasional leisure trips are different – in those cases I
often find transit fun.

Rather, I am envious of the sensation of freedom that one experiences
in an automobile. I don't especially enjoy being in a car – I tend to
find them cramped and stuffy. What is common to all my experiences of
riding in a car, however, is an impression that *this vehicle can go
anywhere*. Let's say I live near the centre of Winnipeg, Manitoba:{% note 1 %} anywhere in my city I want to be, I could go there in a car
in half an hour or less, pretty much. That's extraordinary. Everything
the city has to offer is accessible to me.
