<blockquote>
  Or else there might be a drug in the laurel that could
  have produced such an Apollonian effect. To test this, I have
  crushed laurel leaves and smoked quantities of them in a pipe and
  felt somewhat sick but no more inspired than usual. <mark>And chewed
  them as well for over an hour, and very distinctly felt more
  and more Jaynesian, alas, than Apollonian.</mark>
