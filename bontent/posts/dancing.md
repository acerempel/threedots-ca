  A little dance party with my flatmates reminds me of
  something I wrote a year ago.

This morn­ing, ﬂat­mates and I had a brief dance party in the
liv­ing room. It was a lot of fun—it felt long over­due. It
made me think of [a note I had writ­ten to my­self about a year ago](/posts/dancing-lawrence-st "In which I have danced").
