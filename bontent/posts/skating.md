While skating at the Oval this afternoon with a few
friends, I felt compelled to offer an explanation for why I
was alternating smooth skating with bouts of stumbling:
“Sometimes I space out for a moment and I’m no
longer in the zone! But I just take a moment to
centre myself and it's all right.” My friend thought this
remark expressed a truth about my essence. I think he was
right, but I also think my skates were not laced tightly enough.
