description: I recall how I first met Jocelyn.
---

I first met my fiancée on <time datetime="2017-05-04">May 4th,
2017</time>. I found my record of this incident as I was reading through
my <span class="smallcaps">Catalogue of Days</span>, looking for potential blog-post material.<!-- FOLD --> (I knew
that we had met in May of that year, but I had forgot the exact date.)
At the time, among my housemates was a good high-school friend of hers,
so she was visiting Halifax for a week and stayed with us. I described her in
that <span class="smallcaps">Catalogue</span> entry as <q>pretty cool</q>. (I now have more developed thoughts on
her virtues.)
