title: On oomancy
---

Yesterday evening we had friends over to our apartment for our weekly
oomancy session. As I was sweeping the floor in anticipation of their
arrival, I thought back to the first time I tried my hand at oomancy.<!-- FOLD --> Or maybe
oomancy tried its hand at me: I had not intended to use the eggs for divination, but
in retrospect it is hard for me to deny that divination took
place.

—Sorry: Oomancy is divination by means of eggs. _Oo_ means ‘eggs’
(think _ovo_,  but without the ‘v’), and _mancy_ means ‘, divination by
means of’. Put it together and you have ‘eggs, divination by means of’.
I didn't know this either until about two weeks ago.

This particular morning was my assigned day to
bring breakfast to share after the small religious service that took place
in the Student Union Building early on Wednesday mornings,
which I was accustomed to attend intermittently. I had decided to bring a variation on my
family's traditional weekend breakfast: fresh
blueberry muffins and medium-boiled eggs. Unfortunately, I insisted upon
the _being-fresh_ of the muffins at the expense of my presence at the
service: that is, I baked them the morning of, rather than (as would
have been sensible) the night before. I arose too late; I measured too
carefully; I spent too long whisking the eggs; the hour to leave for the
service passed me by. I said to myself, “No matter! I shall move with
haste and outstrip the passage of the minutes!” Of course the passage of
the minutes was indifferent to my haste.

If you have any experience with
boiling eggs, you will know that there is no way to tell whether they are done
(without cracking the egg open and thereby destroying the integrity of the boiled-egg experience):
the only way to cook them the way you want to is to time them exactly. And if you know this, you
will probably also know that haste and the desire to bend the passage of time are the enemy of exactitude.

Thus, having shuffled in sheepishly to the room shortly after the service had ended, I revealed
my breakfast-cargo, we arranged them on the table, and, upon my friend remarking that I had brought no
implements with which to crack the eggs, I, at a loss, demonstrated my own traditional method of egg-cracking,
namely, I knocked an egg firmly against my forehead, and smashed the runny undercooked egg all over my face.

My friend told me that, for his own part, his mirth more than made up for the loss of the eggs. I was embarrassed and
bemused. At the time I drew from this experience only the narrowly practical lesson of hallowing the timing of the eggs.
Now, though, I am inclined to wonder: what mystical meaning did this *ovum* wish to communicate to me? Does a spiritual
residue of its yolk still reside upon my forehead? What might the science of oomancy have to say about this event?
Will I ever see clearly its true signification?
