  I recount an egg-related incident that I realized in
  retrospect was probably a revelation of my fate.

Yesterday evening we had friends over to our apartment for our weekly
oomancy session. As I was sweeping the floor in anticipation of their
arrival, I reflected upon the first time I tried my hand at oomancy.<!-- FOLD --> Or perhaps, I muse, oomancy tried its hand at me:
I had not intended to use the eggs for divination, but does it not in
retrospect seem possible—even likely—that divination took place?

—Sorry: Oomancy is divination by means of eggs. _Oo_ means ‘eggs’
(think _ovo_,  but without the ‘v’), and _mancy_ means ‘, divination by
means of’. Put it together and you have ‘eggs, divination by means of’.
I didn't know this either until about two weeks ago.

This particular morning was my assigned day to bring breakfast to share
after the small religious service that took place in the Student Union
Building early on Wednesday mornings, which I was accustomed to attend
intermittently. I had decided to bring a variation on my family's
traditional weekend breakfast: fresh blueberry muffins and medium-boiled
eggs. Unfortunately, I insisted upon the _being-fresh_ of the muffins at
the expense of my presence at the service: that is, I baked them the
morning of, rather than (as would have been sensible) the night before.

I arose too late; I measured too carefully; I spent too long whisking
the eggs; the hour to leave for the service passed me by. I said to
myself, “No matter! I shall move with haste and outstrip the passage of
the minutes!” Of course the passage of the minutes was indifferent to my
haste.

—You who are wise in egg-boiling will know that there
is no way to test whether the eggs are done (without cracking the egg open
and thereby destroying the integrity of the boiled-egg experience): the
only way to cook them the way you want to is to time them *exactly*. You may
also have the wisdom to know what I forgot: namely that a compulsive *haste*
and a desire to bend the passage of *time* are inimical to exactitude.

In any case, I arrived at the SUB, shuffling in sheepishly to the room
shortly after the service had ended, and set my out breakfast-cargo on
the table. Upon seeing the eggs, my friend remarked that I had brought
no implements with which to crack them: I, to whom, although sympathetic
towards this point, it would never had occurred to bring utensils for
that purpose, could think of no course of action but to demonstrate my
family’s traditional method of egg-cracking, namely, knocking the egg
firmly against the forehead:—and smashed the runny, undercooked egg all
over my face.

For my friend's part, he told me, his mirth more than made up
for the loss of the eggs. As for me, I was embarrassed and bemused, and
ascribed to the episode no more significance than as a lesson to hallow
the timing of boiling eggs.
Now, though, I am inclined to wonder:
what mystical meaning did this *ovum* wish to communicate to me? Does a
spiritual residue of its yolk still reside upon my forehead? What might
the science of oomancy have to say about this event? Will I ever see
clearly its true signification?
