title: The Rideau Canal
description: I muse that the Rideau Canal is not like a river, but one senses it wants to be like a river. This makes me uneasy.
footnotes:
  - I am not especially familiar with the growth-patterns of rivers. I believe some river valleys were created by glaciers.
  - By way of constrast, one may imagine a canal the tops of whose walls
    are level with the adjacent streets and buildings, and without a
    bufffer of trees—like those of Venice or Amsterdam.

<p>
For the first time in my life, the nearest body of water to where
I live (ignoring little ponds and the like) is artificial rather than natural.<!-- FOLD -->
Previously I lived not far from the Atlantic Ocean; before that, near the Assiniboine
River: but since <time datetime="2020-06-11">June 11th</time>, the Rideau Canal
has been my neighbour.

<p>In some respects, the canal seems to want to
imitate the riverhood of its namesake (namely the Rideau River), yet it is patently a
different kind of being entirely. I want to say, for instance, that I have had picnics with
my friends on the bank of the canal, but in truth the
canal has no banks to speak of—just concrete walls bounding it on both sides, each with a
railing on top, and a paved path flush with the top of the wall.
The water is hardly a few inches below the top of the wall—and the soles of one's feet.
<p>The canal therefore makes no pretense at having come into being in
concert with its surrounding landscape, as rivers do, e.g. by
gradually carving out a valley for itself.<!--% note 1 %--> On the other hand, it is lined on
each side
along much of its length with a sloping strip of narrow forest,
and beyond this, another paved path, and then a lawn several metres wide (this is what I have in mind when I want to say “we picnicked on the
bank of the canal”):——to me this tree-èd slope suggests aspirations towards
riverhood.
It might even engender an illusion of riverhood, if one remains on the grassy area near the
upper path, on the other side of the trees. If, however, one
descends through the trees, down the concrete steps, to the canal-side
pathway, and sees the eerily flat water of the canal, then the illusion
is dissolved.
