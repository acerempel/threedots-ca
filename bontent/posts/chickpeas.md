description: I muse upon my fondness for removing the skin from chickpeas.
---

Whenever I open up and rinse a can of chickpeas, I find myself idly
picking one up and and with two fingers swiftly slipping off its
transparent skin—and then another—a satisfying sensation: soon I am
engrossed in plucking off each of their slippery coats one by one.<!-- FOLD --> I
know I have other things to do—chop sweet potatoes, for instance—my
better judgement protests, but my hands are borne away, unheeding, until
every last chickpea gleams pure *[kabuli][poischiche]*-yellow, unrefracted by its natal
cloak.

I am told that shorn chickpeas make [the smoothest hummus][ethereal].
But I do not want the smoothest hummus; I want only to stand at the sink
shelling chickpeas until the sun sets.
