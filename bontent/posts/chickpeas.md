Whenever I open a can of chickpeas and rinse them, I am overcome with a
desire to take each chickpea and slip off its transparent skin. I find
it so *satisfying* â€“ so that of course I am not satisfied at all until I
have slipped the skin off of every last one. The safest thing for me,
therefore, is never to start in the first place.
