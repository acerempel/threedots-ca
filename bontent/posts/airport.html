      <p>I was pleasantly surprised to find the security area
virtually deserted. The kindly woman standing in front of the
queueing area touched the palms of my hands with a white
hemisphere on the end of a wand and said (having just seen
Paul hug me tight around in circles) how lovely it was to
see such a close-knit family, and wished me a happy new year.
I had to show my boarding pass five times total, three of
those times in the security area. I was the
only one in the x-ray line.<p>—The security staffperson: “No liquids, aerosols, gels,
toiletries, toothpaste, shaving cream, water
bottles?”—I: “No, those things are all in my checked bag.
Well, an empty water bottle.”—”Wait – empty? Does it have
any water in it?”—”No.”—”Okay, then.”</p>
<p>Now it’s ten after eleven and they’re saying the plane
probably won’t arrive for fifteen minutes yet. Guess I’ll go
for another walk or something. A television: the woman on the CBC news
says “we’re so consumeristic, a lot of the things still have
labels in them, the resale market shouldn’t be overlooked.”</p>
<p>I encounter a sign advertising a Chestnut Praline Latte at
Starbucks. I have nothing to do, and am feeling
suggestible; I shall go to the Starbucks and purchase a
chestnut praline latte.—It tastes quite good – a lovely burnt-sugar flavour.</p>
