      <li><b>Jocelyn Veevers</b> writes eloquently at <a href="https://jocelynveevers.wordpress.com" title="Jocelyn Veevers – Reading, sewing, pondering">
        jocelynveevers.wordpress.com</a> about the diverse array of books she reads each month. An outstanding source for recommendations and reviews
        concerning intriguing books that you're (or at least I’m) not likely to have heard of.
      <li>About once every two months, I spend a day reading a couple years’ worth of posts on <a href="https://humantransit.org"
        title="Human Transit – The professional blog of public transit consultant Jarrett Walker.">Human Transit</a>, the blog of <b>Jarrett Walker</b>, a
        public transit consultant from Portland, Oregon. I always come away in an electric daze of contemplation.
      <li>The blog of the late <b>Ursula K. Le Guin</b> is <a href="https://www.ursulakleguin.com/blog-archive"
        title="Ursula K. Le Guin: A Blog">completely wonderful</a>. Much delightful, expressive, and perspicacious writing on such topics as her cat
        (Pard), language, books, the internet, politics, general silliness …
      <li>Lately I have often been reading <b>David Walbert</b>’s writing <a href="http://www.davidwalbert.com/dw/" title="David Walbert: writer, historian, educator, craftsman">on the history of food and convenience, on theology, philosophy, and relating musings</a>.
